Autoamtically a new instance is scaled up when the request comes to the cluster.

=== Delete Knative Service

You can also use `kn` to delete the service that were created, to delete the service named `greeter` run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn service delete greeter
----

[source,bash]
[.console-output]
----
Service 'greeter' successfully deleted in namespace ''.
----

=== Traffic Distribution

To explore the goals of this chapter, we will be using a colors service called `blue-green-canary`, and we'll deploy using YAML files instead of using `kn`.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
.colors-service-blue.yaml
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: blue-green-canary
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/rhdevelopers/blue-green-canary
          env:
            - name: BLUE_GREEN_CANARY_COLOR
              value: "#6bbded"
            - name: BLUE_GREEN_CANARY_MESSAGE
              value: "Hello"
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f colors-service-blue.yaml
----

==== Invoke the Service

Get the service URL,

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kn service describe blue-green-canary -o url
----

Use the URL to open the service in a browser window.If the service was deployed correctly you should see blue background browser page, with greeting as *Hello*.

.Blue Green Canary::Blue
image::blue-green-canary-blue.png[]

=== Deploy a New Revision of a Service

Let us now change the configuration of the service by updating the service environment variable BLUE_GREEN_CANARY_COLOR to make the browser display green color with greeting text as Namaste.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
.colors-service-green.yaml
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: blue-green-canary
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: quay.io/rhdevelopers/blue-green-canary
          env:
            - name: BLUE_GREEN_CANARY_COLOR
              value: "#5bbf45"
            - name: BLUE_GREEN_CANARY_MESSAGE
              value: "Namaste"
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f colors-service-green.yaml
----

Now invoking the service again using the service URL, will show a green color browser page with greeting Namaste.

.Blue Green Canary::Green
image::blue-green-canary-green.png[]

==== Revisions

Check to ensure you have two revisions of the blue-green-canary service:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn revision list
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                        SERVICE             TRAFFIC   TAGS   GENERATION   AGE     CONDITIONS   READY   REASON

----

=== Tag Revisions

As you had observed that the Knative service `blue-green-canary` now has two revisions namely *blue-green-canary-00001* and *blue-green-canary-00002*. As the Revision names are autogenerated it is hard to comprehend to which code/configuration set it corresponds to. To overcome this problem Knative provides *tagging* of revision names that allows one to tag a revision name to a logical human understanable names called *tags*.

As our colors service shows different colors on the browser let us tag the revisions with color,

List the existing revisions,

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn revision list -s blue-green-canary
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                        SERVICE             TRAFFIC   TAGS   GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
blue-green-canary-00002   blue-green-canary   100%             2            23m   3 OK / 4     True
blue-green-canary-00001   blue-green-canary                    1            51m   3 OK / 4     True
----

When Knative rolls out a new revision, it increments the `GENERATION` by *1* and then routes *100%* of the `TRAFFIC` to it, hence we can use the `GENERATION` or `TRAFFIC` to identify the latest reivsion. 

==== Tag Blue

Let us tag `blue-green-canary-00001` which shows *blue* browser page with tag name `blue`.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+,+quotes"]

----

Let us query the Service Revisions again,

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn revision list -s blue-green-canary
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
NAME                        SERVICE             TRAFFIC   TAGS    GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
blue-green-canary-00002   blue-green-canary   100%      #latest,green#   2            29m   3 OK / 4     True
blue-green-canary-00001   blue-green-canary             #blue#    1            57m   3 OK / 4     True
----

As *green* happend to be latest revision it has been tagged with name `lastest` in addition to `green`.

Let us use the tag names for easier identification of the revision and perform traffic distribution amongst them.

=== Applying Blue-Green Deployment Pattern

Knative offers a simple way of switching 100% of the traffic from one Knative service revision (blue) to another newly rolled out revision (green). If the new revision (e.g. green) has erroneous behavior then it is easy to rollback the change.

In this exercise you will applying the Blue/Green deployment pattern with the Knative Service called greeter. You have already deployed two <<deploying-revisions,revisions>> of blue-green-canary identified using the tags  `blue` and `green`.

With the deployment of *green* revison you noticed that Knative automatically started to routing 100% of the traffic to `blue-green-canary-00002`. 

Now let us assume, due to a critical bug  we need to roll back `green` to `blue`.

The following Knative Service YAML is identical to the previously deployed `green` except that we have added the _traffic_ section to indicate that 100% of the traffic should be routed to `blue`.

Before you rollback the revision, refresh the browser window where you have opened the blue-green-canary service, to make sure it is still showing *green* browser page with greeting *Namaste*.

Now apply the update Knative service configuration using the command as shown in following listing:

==== Rollback to blue

Route all the traffic of service `blue-green-canary` to blue revision of the service:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kn service update blue-green-canary --traffic blue=100,green=0,latest=0
----

NOTE: We use the tag names to identify the revisions

Let us list all revisions with tags:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kn revision list
----

Based on the revision tags that we created earlier, the output should be like:

[.console-output]
[source,text,subs="quotes"]
----
NAME                        SERVICE             TRAFFIC   TAGS           GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
blue-green-canary-00002   blue-green-canary             latest,green   2            56m   4 OK / 4     True
blue-green-canary-00001   blue-green-canary   #100%#      #blue#           1            83m   4 OK / 4     True
----

Let us list the available sub-routes:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl get ksvc blue-green-canary -oyaml \
 | yq r - 'status.traffic[*].url'
----

The above command should return you three sub-routes for the main `greeter` route:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes"]
----
http://latest-blue-green-canary.knativetutorial.192.168.64.13.nip.io #<.>
http://blue-blue-green-canary.knativetutorial.192.168.64.13.nip.io #<.>
http://green-blue-green-canary.knativetutorial.192.168.64.13.nip.io  #<.>
----
<1> the sub route for the traffic tag `latest`
<2> the sub route for the traffic tag `blue`
<3> the sub route for the traffic tag `green`

You will notice that the command does not create any new configuration/revision/deployment as there was no application update (e.g. image tag, env var, etc), but when you call the service, Knative scales up the `blue` that shows *blue* browser page with greeting *Hello*.

.Blue Green Canary::Blue
image::blue-green-canary-blue.png[]

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kubectl get pods
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
blue-green-canary-00001-deployment-54597d94b9-25x4r#   2/2     Running       0          12s
blue-green-canary-00002-deployment-6cb545df65-ktqc2   0/2     Terminating   0          2m
----

Since `blue` is the active revision now, the existing `green` pod is getting terminated as no future requests will be served by it.

[TIP]
====
As an exercise, flip all the traffic back to `green` using `kn` command.
====

==== Applying Canary Release Pattern

A Canary release is more effective when you want to reduce the risk of introducing new feature. It allows you a more effective feature-feedback loop before rolling out the change to your entire user base.

Knative allows you to split the traffic between revisions in increments as small as 1%.

To see this in action, apply the following Knative service definition that will split the traffic 80% to 20% between `blue` and `green`.

To roll out the greeter canary deployment use the following command:

.Create greeter canary Deployment

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kn service update blue-green-canary \
  --traffic="blue=80" \
  --traffic="green=20" 
----

As in the previous section on <<blue-green>> deployments, the command will not create any new configuration/revision/deployment. To observe the traffic distribution, open the Service Route URL in your browser window. 

You will notice the browser alternating betwee green and blue color, with majority of the time staying with blue.

image::blue-green-canary.gif[]

You should also notice that two pods are running representing both `blue` and `green`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kubectl get pods
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----

blue-green-canary-00002-deployment-8564bf5b5b-gtvh4   2/2     Running   0          14s

[#servelessing-service]
== Serverlessing Todo Service

One of the key aspects of services running under serverless architecture, is the startup time. 
This application might take around 6 seconds to start in the RedHat Sandbox machines. 

This is fine for long-running services, but in serverless where the cluster might start and stop the service pretty often, the startup time becomes important.

Quarkus integrates with GraalVM to compile the Java application into native binary file speeding up the start up times and the usage memory.

[#native-compile]
== Compile to native 

Start your local Docker/Podman/CRI-O instance, and run the following command in the terminal to compile to native, create a container image and push it:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-native
----

We override the tag value to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-native` to have both JVM and native containers correctly tagged.

[#deploy-native]
== Deploy

To deploy the application as a KNative service, create a new file with name `service.yaml` with the following content:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml]
.service.yaml
----
